## How to run

1. Change working directory to `SSIN1920_OAUTH2.0/src`
2. Open 3 different terminals
3. Start each service (Client, AuthServer, ProtectedResource) by executing the following command per service: `node Service/Service.js`
4. Open the service in your browser
5. Ready to use the OAuth protocol

**Note:** In the authorization and protected resource servers you must reload the page so that the logs can be displayed on the screen. We could have done this without having to reload the page automatically, however that is out of scope of the current project.
